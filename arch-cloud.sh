# TODO first: refactor arch-vm.sh into a collection of scripts.
# TODO:
#  Prompt for image, or make a new one.
#  Start up VM.
#  Add local SSH keys to VM / project.
#  Trigger the appropriate arch-install.sh factors (after refactoring it.)
#  Add VNC-over-VPN configuration per https://medium.com/google-cloud/linux-gui-on-the-google-cloud-platform-800719ab27c5#.igi2a5x4g
#   Or, VNC-over-SSH-tunnel, like http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/vnc/sshvnc.html
