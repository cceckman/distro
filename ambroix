Usage:
  $0 [-p <pfpath>] [-u <pfpath>] <platform> <user>

  <platform> is one of the subdirectories of platforms/.
  <user> is the user account to set up on the target machine. Optionally,
    it may also be a directory in users/.
  
  <pfpath> are optional paths to the platform (-p) and user (-u) promptfiles,
    containing saved information from the last time information was requested
    from the user. These allow a user to bypass the 'prompt' hooks if a previous
    run of the script was aborted.
    These paths may point to files that don't exist, in which case the results
    of prompts will be written to them.

Requires, on the host machine:
  which; mktemp; bash; grep; and anything required from the platform-dependent
  "verify" hook.

See $SITE for more complete usage information.
