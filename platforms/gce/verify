The Google Cloud SDK is not installed, or the gcloud command is not in your
PATH.

You can find instructions for installing the Google Cloud SDK at
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/. Please be aware of the risks and concerns
invovled with piping 'curl' to 'bash'.

When you've installed the Google Cloud SDK, you can run Ambroix again.
